      "Explanation:\n",
      "SSH (Secure Shell) is a network protocol used for secure remote access to devices. It allows users to log in to a remote device and execute commands as if they were physically present at the device. However, if an unauthorized user gains access to the network through SSH, they can cause significant damage by stealing sensitive information, modifying configurations, or launching other attacks.\n",

      "Explanation:\n",
      "Firmware is a type of software that is embedded in hardware devices, such as routers, to control their functionality. It is responsible for managing the device's hardware components and providing the necessary instructions for it to function properly. If there are issues with the firmware, it can cause the device to malfunction or even crash, resulting in a system restart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommendation:\n",
      "To address this issue, it is recommended to check the firmware version of the router and ensure that it is up to date. If there are any known bugs or vulnerabilities in the current firmware version, it is important to upgrade to a newer version that addresses these issues. Additionally, it is recommended to regularly monitor the router's performance and logs to identify any potential firmware issues and address them promptly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion:\n",
      "In conclusion, the unexpected system restart on Router1 could be a result of firmware issues. It is important to regularly update the firmware and monitor the router's performance to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future. \n",

      "Overutilization of Resources\n",
      "Anomaly Report: \n",
      "Jun 3 10:15:09 Router1 %QOS-5-QOS_FLOW_MONITORING: 80% of bandwidth utilization reached on GigabitEthernet0/0\n",
      "Jun 3 10:15:09 Router1 %QOS-5-QOS_FLOW_MONITORING: 80% of bandwidth utilization reached on GigabitEthernet0/1\n",
      "2024-06-02T13:35:45Z [WARNING] Unexpected decrease in interface GigabitEthernet0/1 bandwidth utilization.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Report:\n",
      "\n",
      "Problem:\n",
      "The logs show that there is an overutilization of resources on the router, specifically on the GigabitEthernet0/0 and GigabitEthernet0/1 interfaces. This means that the bandwidth utilization on these interfaces has reached 80%, which is a high level and can lead to network congestion and performance issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Possible Causes:\n",
      "1. Increased network traffic: The sudden increase in bandwidth utilization could be due to a spike in network traffic, which could be caused by a large number of users or devices accessing the network at the same time.\n",
      "2. Misconfigured QoS policies: The Quality of Service (QoS) policies on the router may not be properly configured, leading to inefficient use of bandwidth and overutilization of resources.\n",
      "3. Network bottleneck: There could be a bottleneck in the network, causing congestion and leading to high bandwidth utilization on specific interfaces.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommendations:\n",
      "1. Monitor network traffic: It is important to monitor network traffic to identify any spikes or unusual patterns that could be causing the overutilization of resources. This can be done using network monitoring tools or by analyzing network traffic logs.\n",
      "2. Review QoS policies: Review and optimize the QoS policies on the router to ensure that bandwidth is allocated efficiently and prioritize critical traffic.\n",
